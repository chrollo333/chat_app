# LoungeChat

**LoungeChat** is a real-time web chat application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Node.js** (Express), and **Socket.IO**.
My plan is for it to be a scaled down amalgamation of watch2together and "listen2gether" (Spotify listening along integration) for small casual groups with different themes for the chat rooms.
It currently features a live chat room (with plans to add more rooms), user-defined dynamic chat colors , and some cozy vibes.

-  Store chat room history in the database.
-  MAYBE add authentication (want it to be casual but might scale up)
